<p>In the ALPS Lab we study the inference processes involved in language production and comprehension. We study both sides of the communicative coin: how speakers choose an utterance to convey an intended meaning and how listeners arrive at interpretations that are often much richer and more detailed than the utteranceâ€™s literal meaning. To develop and test explicit theories of these processes, we employ linguistic analysis, behavioral experiments, corpus methods, and computational modeling.</p>
