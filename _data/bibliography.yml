  title: Morpheme Ordering Across Languages Reflects Optimization for Processing Efficiency
  abstract: "The ordering of morphemes in a word displays well-documented regularities across languages. Previous work has explained these in terms of notions such as semantic scope, relevance, and productivity. Here, we test a recently formulated processing theory of the ordering of linguistic units, the efficient tradeoff hypothesis (Hahn et al., 2021). The claim of the theory is that morpheme ordering can partly be explained by the optimization of a tradeoff between memory and surprisal. This claim has received initial empirical support from two languages. In this work, we test this idea more extensively using data from four additional agglutinative languages with significant amounts of morphology, and by considering nouns in addition to verbs. We find that the efficient tradeoff hypothesis predicts ordering in most cases with high accuracy, and accounts for cross-linguistic regularities in noun and verb inflection. Our work adds to a growing body of work suggesting that many ordering properties of language arise from a pressure for efficient language processing."

  title: Evaluating models of referring expression production on an emerging sign language
  abstract: "Redundant modification in referring expression production varies both within language (e.g., English speakers produce more redundant color than size modifiers) and cross- linguistically (e.g., English speakers produce more redundant color modifoers than Spanish speakers). It is an open question whether these asymmetries are the result of asymmetries in the general referential utility of color and size modifiers or of incremental language processing pressures. Cross-linguistic investigations of redundant modification are important to this debate: similar cross-linguistic rates of redundant modification would suggest a strong role for general referential utility. In contrast, lower prevalence of redundant modification in languages with post-nominal modification suggests a strong role for incrementality. Here, we test whether differences in redundant adjective use are systematic for a particularly interesting language: Central Taurus Sign Language. As a language in its infancy, CTSL has no established conventions, and therefore provides us with a unique opportunity to explore how redundancy emerges in the initial stages of language formation. We evaluate different computational models of referring expression that each make different assumptions regarding the source of asymmetries in the production of redundant modifiers."

  title: "‘Sally the Congressperson’: The Role of Individual Ideology on the Processing and Production of English Gender-Neutral Role Nouns"
  abstract: "Language and gender are inextricably linked; we regularly make reference to the genders of individuals around us, and the language used to do so recursively feeds the biases we hold about gender in the social world. What has been left under-investigated is the role that individual, rather than societally-held, ideologies about gender play in the linguistic system. In two web-based studies, we investigate the pro- cessing and production of gender-neutral role nouns such as congressperson as a function of individual gender ideology and political alignment. Our results indicate an asymmetry between the processing and production of such nouns: while individuals’ gender ideologies do not modulate processing, they do interact with political party in production tasks such that Democratic participants with more progressive gender ideologies produce more gender-neutral role nouns. We argue that these forms have become linguistic resources for indexing social progressiveness, leading to their use by Democrats and avoidance by Republicans."

  title: Satiation effects generalize across island types
  abstract: "A recent proposal of syntactic satiation claims that it is driven by adaptation: comprehenders track and update their beliefs about the probability of observing certain sentences, leading to subsequent increases in the acceptability of those sentences. This leaves open what the representational targets of satiation are, that is: what is the tracked information that belief update is based on? In two acceptability judgment experiments, we show that exposure to one type of island violation can lead to the satiation of another island type, suggesting that island type-general representations are tracked by comprehenders in addition to island type-specific representations. The same experimental paradigm can be used for further exploration of the representational targets of satiation."

  title: The role of production expectations in visual world paradigm linking hypotheses
  abstract: "While widely used in psycholinguistics, the linking hypothesis for eye movements in the visual world paradigm is still poorly understood. Recent work on linking hypotheses for referential tasks in particular has found mixed support for the Referential Belief Link: that the proportion of looks to a referent in a time window reflects participants’ degree of belief that the referent is the intended target in that time window. Here we test the hypothesis that participants’ expectations for the utterances observed in an experiment modulate the extent to which the Referential Belief Link holds. This hypothesis is motivated by a simple idea: when utterances are unexpected, listeners engage in additional reasoning to make sense of the observed signal. In a re-analysis of a previous eye movement and incremental decision task dataset, in conjunction with two novel production experiments, we find that the more surprising an observed utterance is, the smaller the correlation between explicit and implicit beliefs is. We discuss the importance of participants’ production expectations in research using the visual world paradigm."

  title: "Modeling word and morpheme order in natural language as an efficient tradeoff of memory and surprisal"
  keywords:
  abstract: "Memory limitations are known to constrain language comprehension and production, and have been argued to account for crosslinguistic word order regularities. However, a systematic assessment of the role of memory limitations in language structure has proven elusive, in part because it is hard to extract precise large-scale quantitative generalizations about language from existing mechanistic models of memory use in sentence processing. We provide an architecture-independent information-theoretic formalization of memory limitations which enables a simple calculation of the memory efficiency of languages. Our notion of memory efficiency is based on the idea of a memory--surprisal tradeoff: a certain level of average surprisal per word can only be achieved at the cost of storing some amount of information about past context. Based on this notion of memory usage, we advance the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis: the order of elements in natural language is under pressure to enable favorable memory-surprisal tradeoffs. We derive that languages enable more efficient tradeoffs when they exhibit information locality: when predictive information about an element is concentrated in its recent past. We provide empirical evidence from three test domains in support of the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis: a reanalysis of a miniature artificial language learning experiment, a large-scale study of word order in corpora of 54 languages, and an analysis of morpheme order in two agglutinative languages. These results suggest that principles of order in natural language can be explained via highly generic cognitively motivated principles and lend support to efficiency-based models of the structure of human language."

  title: "Predicting scalar inferences from ''or'' to ''not both'' using neural sentence encoders"
  abstract: "Neural networks have recently successfully learned to predict some pragmatic inferences (e.g., Jeretic et al. (2020); Jiang and de Marneffe (2019)). For instance, Schuster et al. (2020) trained a neuralnetwork to predict human ratings of scalar inference strength from “some” to the negation of a stronger alternative with “all”. However, it remains an open question to what extent these results are specific to the inference from “some” to “not all” or whether they generalize to other types of scalar inferences. We thus explore to what extent a neural network can learn to predict a different widely studied scalar inference: that from “or” to the negation of a stronger alternative with “and”."

  title: "Modeling cross-linguistic production of referring expressions"
  abstract: We present a novel probabilistic model of referring expression production, synthesizing recent analyses proposed within the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework (Frank and Goodman, 2012). Our model makes incremental utterance choice predictions (Cohn-Gordon et al. 2018a; Cohn-Gordon et al. 2018b) and assumes a non-deterministic semantics for adjectives in referring expressions (Degen et al. 2020). The model captures previously attested production patterns in reference game experiments, including English speakers’ tendency to produce redundant color adjectives more frequently than redundant size adjectives, as well as Spanish speakers’ tendency to employ redundant color adjectives less frequently than English speakers. We report the predictions made by the model under various parameter regimes, motivating future empirical work.

  title: Prior beliefs modulate projection
  abstract: "Beliefs about the world affect language processing and interpretation in several empirical domains. In two experiments, we tested whether subjective prior beliefs about the probability of utterance content modulate projection, that is, listeners’ inferences about speaker commitment to that content. We find that prior beliefs predict projection at both the group and the by-participant level: the higher the prior belief in a content, the more speakers are taken to be committed to it. This result motivates the integration of formal analyses of projection with cognitive theories of language understanding."

  title: Perceptual difficulty differences predict asymmetry in redundant modification with color and material adjectives
  volume: 6
  numer: 1
  pages: 676-688
  doi: https://doi.org/10.3765/plsa.v6i1.5003
  abstract: "When referring to objects, speakers are often more specific than neces- sary for the purpose of establishing unique reference, e.g., by producing redundant modifiers. A computational model of referring expression production that accounts for many of the key patterns in redundant adjectival modification assumes that adjectives differ in how noisy (reliable), and consequently, how useful they are for reference. Here we investigate one hypothesis about the source of the assumed adjectival noise: that it reflects the perceptual difficulty of establishing whether the property denoted by the adjective holds of the contextually relevant objects. In Exp.1, we collect perceptual difficulty norms for items that vary in color and material. In Exp. 2, we test the highest (material) and lowest (color) perceptual dif- ficulty items in a reference game and find that material is indeed less likely to be mentioned redundantly, replicating previous work. In Exp. 3, we obtain norms for the tested items in a second perceptual difficulty measure with the aim of testing the effect of perceptual difficulty within property type. The overall results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that the propensity to redundantly use color over material adjectives may be driven by the relative ease of assessing an object’s color, compared to the relative difficulty of assessing its material."

  title: Syntactic satiation is driven by speaker-specific adaptation
  abstract: Listeners adapt to variability in language use by updating their expectations over variants, often in speaker-specific ways. We propose that adaptation of this sort contributes to satiation, the phenomenon whereby the acceptability of unacceptable sentences increases after repeated exposure. We provide support for an adaptation account of satiation by showing that the satiation of purportedly unaccept- able island-violating constructions demonstrates speaker- specificity, a key property of adaptation.

  title: "Seeing is believing: testing an explicit linking assumption for visual world eye-tracking in psycholinguistics"
  abstract: "Experimental investigation is fundamental to theory-building in cognitive science, but its value depends on the linking as- sumptions made by researchers about the mapping between empirical measurements and theoretical constructs. We ar- gue that sufficient clarity and justification are often lacking for linking assumptions made in visual world eye-tracking, a widely used experimental method in psycholinguistic research. We test what we term the Referential Belief linking assump- tion: that the proportion of looks to a referent in a time window reflects participants’ degree of belief that the referent is the in- tended target in that time window. We do so by comparing eye-tracking data against explicit beliefs collected in an incre- mental decision task (Exp. 1), which replicates a scalar impli- cature processing study (Exp. 3 of Sun & Breheny, 2020). In Exp. 2, we replicate Sun and Breheny (2020) in a web-based eye-tracking paradigm using WebGazer.js. The results pro- vide support for the Referential Belief link and cautious opti- mism for the prospect of conducting web-based eye-tracking. We discuss limitations on both fronts."

  title: What do eye movements in the visual world reflect? A case study from adjectives
  abstract: "A common dependent measure used in visual-world eye-tracking experiments is the proportion of looks to a visually depicted object in a certain time window after the onset of the critical stimulus. When interpreting such data, a common assumption is that looks to the object reflect the listener’s belief that the object is the intended target referent. While this is intuitively plausible (at least for paradigms in which the task requires selecting a referent), relatively little is known about how exactly the proportion of looks to an object is related to a listener’s current belief about that object. Here, we test a simple, explicit linking hypothesis: the proportion of looks to an object reflects the probability that the listener assigns to the object being the target. To test this hypothesis, we supplement the eye-tracking data from Leffel, Xiang, and Kennedy (2016) with an offline incremental decision task to measure participants’ beliefs about the intended referent at various points in the unfolding sentence, and assess the extent to which these beliefs predict the eye-tracking data. The results suggest that the degree to which an object is believed to be the referent is only one factor that affects eye movements in referential tasks. Preliminary free production data we have collected for the scenes suggests that utterance expectations also play a role. We discuss methodological implications of these results for experimental linguistics."
